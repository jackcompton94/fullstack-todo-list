# fullstack-todo-list
end-to-end React, Flask, and BigQuery todo list


 
## Purpose
The primary goal of this project was not just to build a to-do list application, but rather to gain a deep understanding of how web applications are designed and function across the entire technology stack. I aimed to explore and implement the following:

- Building a responsive and interactive frontend using React.
- Developing a robust backend using Flask, handling user authentication, and managing to-do list data.
- Storing and querying data efficiently in BigQuery.
- Understanding the end-to-end flow of user interactions in a full-stack application.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Database:** BigQuery
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Deployment:** Heroku

## Features
- User registration and authentication.
- Creating, editing, and deleting to-do list items.
- Storing user data securely in BigQuery.
- Responsive design for a seamless user experience on different devices.
